# dotfiles
dotfiles for personal use. dotfiles are custom user configuration files.
They usually start with a period, hence the name. I've included reasoning as to why I use what.
I use i3 on Antergos with Xfce4 programs as needed. Running on a Thinkpad X1 Carbon (gen. 5).
Always improving for better looks and productivity. Always learning.

# Managing dotfiles
I used [Brandon Invergo's guide](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) and GNU Stow to manage my dotfiles.
